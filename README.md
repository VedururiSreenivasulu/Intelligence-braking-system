# Intelligence-braking-system
This project gives an overview of the creation of a prototype of an Intelligent Braking System (IBS) based on ultrasonic sensors and microcontroller programming. The system aims to make vehicles safer by automatically sensing obstructions and initiating the braking process with minimal input from humans
