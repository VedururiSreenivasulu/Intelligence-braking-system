# 🚗 Intelligent Braking System – Prototype Project

![Prototype](prototype.jpg)

An **Intelligent Braking System (IBS)** represents a significant advancement in automotive safety, combining sensors, control algorithms, and artificial intelligence to prevent accidents, reduce braking distances, and improve vehicle stability in emergency scenarios.

This project explores the design, functionality, and implementation of intelligent braking systems, demonstrating their impact on road safety and their integration with modern vehicle technologies.

## 📌 Abstract

The advancement of intelligent braking systems marks a critical milestone in automotive safety. This project explores systems such as:

- **Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)**
- **Electronic Stability Control (ESC)**
- **Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB)**
- **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)**

These systems collectively enhance control, reduce accident risks, and ensure optimal braking in dynamic driving environments.

Intelligent braking systems use a combination of sensors, actuators, and decision-making algorithms to monitor road conditions, detect obstacles, and adapt braking responses. With the integration of **AI and machine learning**, these systems now offer predictive analysis and real-time safety interventions.

The project further investigates how V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) and V2I (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure) communication can elevate braking performance and cooperative safety on smart roads.
